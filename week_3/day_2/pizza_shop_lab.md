##### Objectives

- Complete CRUD actions
- Add more functionality to analysis model

So far we have created new objects of Pizzas and persisted them as rows in our DB with the .save method.

We have also read from the DB with the .all method we created.

Complete our CRUD actions with an update and a delete.

- Think about whether the action is based on the instance or the class.

##### Extension:

Add further functionality to the sales model
