## Pet Store

You have been asked to create an app that will allow the owner of a Pet Store chain manage his stores and stock.

You must be able to:

* Create Pet Stores
* Edit Pet Stores
* Delete Pet Stores
* List Pet Stores

Every pet store should have a name, a 1 line address and a stock type e.g "exotic".

You must also be able to:

* Create pets
* Edit Pets
* Delete Pets

Pet's must have a name, a type (beware reserved words) and an image.

When a pet is created it must be associated with a pet store.
