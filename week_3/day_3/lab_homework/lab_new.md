# Sinatra Week 2 Day 1 Lab/Homework

## Pet Store

You have been asked to create an app that will allow the owner of a Pet Store chain manage their stores and stock(pets).

They would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Pet Stores
* Create and Save Pets

* List all the pets of a store
* Show the store a pet belongs to

Every pet store should have a name, a 1 line address and a stock type e.g "exotic".
Pets should have a name, and a type.


Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

* Find Pet Stores by their ID
* Edit Pet Stores
* Delete Pet Stores
* List All Pet Stores

* Find Pets by their ID
* Edit Pets
* Delete Pets
* List All Pets
