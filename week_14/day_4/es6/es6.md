# Intro

So we've gotten pretty comfortable with es5 - we know how to do lots of cool things like make instances of things, create variables, write functions etc. In this lesson, we're going to do the same thing but with the new es6 goodness.

## What the hell is es6?

ES6 is the 6th edition of ECMAScript - named as such since it's curated and standardised by ECMA international. It was initially based on JavaScript which now shadows this standardisation and is implemented by Google's V8 engine and in turn Node.js.

Once the new specification has been agreed, both Node and the browsers will implement it at their own sweet pace but you'll notice that sometimes features sneak in as they appear in the drafts.

# ES6 in action

We're going to learn es6 by looking at some little examples we willthen refactor.

[i:] Use split pane in Sublime to demo before and after (cmd + alt + number key)
