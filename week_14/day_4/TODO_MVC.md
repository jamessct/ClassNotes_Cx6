#Other Frameworks

We've been learning React this week and building applications from scratch. Counters and comments and banks.

This is cool but in your first job, it's more likely that you'll be given a task that involves an existing codebase which will probably be using some kind of framework or library.

Homework tonight is to take an existing app and make alterations to it.

- Go to www.todomvc.com
- Choose 2 of the implementations (One could be React)
- Clone the repo onto your computer
- Add the string 'done!' to the task title when the task is marked as completed
- Add an edit button next to the delete 'x'

- If you get that finished quickly, add another feature of your own invention.

##How does this help my Career?

###Dealing With an alien codebase in an unfamiliar Framework.

In your first job - in fact throughout your career - you'll come across code written in with libraries or frameworks that are unfamiliar to you. 

You'll probably have no idea what's going on. 

This can be frustrating and demoralising. The old Imposter demon might come to call. 

Let's see how we can knock him out cold.

###A Plan of Attack

We need a plan of attack. Ultimately we really want to gain as much context as we can.

1. Identify what library(ies) or framework the application is using. Go and check out the docs. Read the getting started. 
2. You're just gaining the big picture. At this point you just want to know where stuff is at.
3. Your boss has probably given you q task to do. You don't have time to become an expert in this framework. But you do need to know where in the code you need to look, in order to complete the task.
4. What does the framework call Models View and Controllers (they all use different words) and where is it at in the code?

###Going Deeper

1. Run the application
2. Explore the file structure
3. Sometimes breaking the app intentionally can reveal a lot. Get it to throw an error and see what it says.
4. See what JS files are being loaded 
5. See what libraries are being loaded

You're trying to infer what does what in the app. Where is the View stuff happening? Where is the Model? Where's the controller that binds the two together.

Remember, we're just trying to get a basic overview and understanding of how an application is structured so that we can implement a new feature or make changes to existing code.

We're not trying to learn a framework 100% before we can contribute as a developer. That would be unrealistic and take way too much time. 

So the skill we're trying to learn is spotting ***patterns*** and recognising familiar and common ways these frameworks work.

##Be Like Tofu

Huh? When you get dropped into a new codebase, be like tofu. Absorb the flavours of how the code is structured and written. 

Be consistent with what already exists when you're adding or changing stuff. Even if there IS (or you think there is) a better way to do it. E.G. If the code uses semi-colons, put them in.

##Sherlock Holmes of Code

We need to become detectives.

 Remember there is no magic in the world of computing. Everything is discoverable, it was all made by other humans. You just need to be a detective and be able to find things out.
