#Lab/Homework - Practice

Your task is to revise what we've done today using the app you created last night:

Add at least one other button which has it's own way of getting an answer to a question and displays that answer on another page. 

Have fun and feel free to be creative with your answers :-) 

Perhaps you might want to have different 'people' providing different answers, with a button for each 'person'

If you want, investigate adding other types of views to activities. 

Feel free to look into styling etc.
