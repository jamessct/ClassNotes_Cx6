#Lab/Homework - Practice

Your task is to extend on what we've done in class today.

Create another model for storing answers. This does not necessarily have to be a subclass of our ```Answers``` class but it ***must*** implement the ```Answerable``` interface.

Modify the Eight-Ball App so that the user can get answers from this new model.

Like last night's homework, you may want to have different buttons which get answers from different models
