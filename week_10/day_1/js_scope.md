#JS Scope

##Learning Objectives
- Describe scope of local variables
- Describe scope of global variables
- Explain local variables come first in the function scope chain.
- State the importance of using var
- Describe the scope of closures
- Create a closure that uses a variable from an outer function.

##Function scope

Variables created in functions have function scope,  they can be seen anywhere inside the function but nowhere else.

We can't see them directly outside the function.

```
var talk = function(){
	var name = "Rick";
	console.log('My name is' + name);
}

console.log( 'trying to access result' + name );
```

Or from another function

```
var talk = function(){
	var name = "Rick";
	console.log('My name is' + name);
}

var walk = function(){
	console.log( name + 'is walking' );
}

walk();
```

##Global variables

Variables which are defined not inside a function have global scope. They can been seen anywhere.

Let's see how we access a global variable from within a function.

```
	var name = 'Jay';//global
	var talk = function(){
		console.log('My name is ' + name);
	}
	talk();
```

If we define a local variable it will take priority in our function over the global variable - shadowing.

```
	var name = 'Jay';//global
	var talk = function(){
		var name = 'Rick';//local
		console.log('My name is ' + name);
	}
	talk();
	console.log('the global name', name);
```

If we forget to use var,  then instead of creating a new local variable the global variable will be reassigned.

```
	var name = 'Jay';//global
	var talk = function(){
		name = 'Rick';//resassigning global
		console.log('My name is' + name);
	}
	talk();
	console.log('the global name', name);
```

Horribly,  even if we don't have a global and we forget var, then  JS will not make a fuss and assign a new global.   Errrgghh.  

```
	var talk = function(){
		name = 'Rick';//assigning global
		console.log('My name is ' + name);
	}
	talk();
	console.log('the global is ' + name);
```

##Closures

Let's create a function to greet someone

```
	var greet = function(isHappy){
		if(isHappy){
			console.log('Hello my friend');
		}else{
			console.log('Mind your own buisness');
		}
	}

	greet(true)
```
In Javascript we can have functions within functions.  We could refactor our function to use a nested function. (this example is a little contrived)

```
	var greet = function(isHappy){
		var text = ''
		if(isHappy){
			text = 'Hello my friend';
		}else{
			text = 'Mind your own buisness';
		}
		var displayText = function(){
			console.log(text);
		}

		displayText();
	}

	greet(true)
```
How does this work?  How did displayText get access to the text variable.  It is not Global, or a local variable to the displayText function.


Functions in Javascript are closures.  The function 'remembers' the environment in which it was created.

Functions have access to all the variables that are in the scope of its outer function.


Task: 15mins, What do we think the output will be here?

```
	var globalVariable = 99;
	var separateFunction = function(){
		var separateA = 2;
	}
	var outerFunction = function(){
		var outerA = 1;
		var innerFunction = function(){
			console.log('outerA ', outerA);
			console.log('globalVariable', globalVariable)
			console.log('separateA ', separateA);
		}

		innerFunction()
	}

	outerFunction()
```
