# Homework

To go over what we have done to day, you're going to complete the little quiz (quiz.md) by writing your answers in the file. Some the questions will be based on the start_code we give out.

For extra practice, you can then use the code and complete the following task:

1. Add JS code to allow a new cat to be added programmatically. Do it rough and ready at first!
2. Refactor the code to make it easy to add a new cat, just like we did with the quotes.
3. OPTIONAL: Remove the cat data in the HTML and add them via your javascript. If you want to be fancy, put the cat data into an array.

Hint: Be careful with the order you append your elements to each other!
Also be careful with what you need to pass when setting an image's width via the DOM.
