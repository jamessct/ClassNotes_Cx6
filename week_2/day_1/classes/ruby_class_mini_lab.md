# Classes Lab

In this lab, we'd like you to make a class of your own. Something that you find interesting, it can be anything. It must:

* have at least 3 properties (instance variables)
* have getters and setters for those properties
* have at least 2 behaviours (methods)
* be test driven

If you are stuck for ideas, you can make a Cat class. It has a name, a favourite food and a colour. It must be able to walk (just puts "I am walking") and sleep (puts "I am sleeping").
