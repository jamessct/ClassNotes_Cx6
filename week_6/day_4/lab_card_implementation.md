# Card Game Lab - Implementation

Your task now is to implement, in Java, the models you came up with in your planning.

Write the code to set up a game of cards. The number of players and the number of cards dealt to each player is your choice but it is probably best to start with quite a small number (e.g. two players, three cards each). 

Remember to use TDD!
