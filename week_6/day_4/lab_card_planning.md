# Card Game Lab - Planning

The goal of this lab is to think about how you model the elements involved in a game of cards. 

These include (but are not limited to): players, cards, hands of cards, cards being dealt, turns being taken, a game ready to be played... 

There are then also rules about how you determine who's won, but for the moment don't think about the details of those, just about the setup of the game. How do you get to the point where you have some players holding cards ready to play? 

At this stage we are only asking you to PLAN how you would do this i.e. think about which classes you think you would need, any interfaces you would use etc. 

Think about which design principles and patterns might be relevant. How might you make some of the code reusable?

Remember to think about what tests you would need.
